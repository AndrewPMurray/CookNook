Download Skeleton or create files

Create Repo (navigate to folder to be used as repo root):
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin <<INSERT LINK TO GIT REPO>>
    git push -u origin Main

Install packages using npm (npm install)
    Some packages need to be specific versions as follows:
        - pg: 8.6.0
        - sequelize: 5.x.x

To generate and set session secret:
    - npm install uuid
    - run node and type the following commands:
        - const { v4:uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
        - uuidv4();
    - put the output of uuidv4 into the .env (as SESSION_SECRET)
    - update config/index.js to include sessionSecret
    - update app.js to import sessionSecret:
        - const { sessionSecret } = require('./config')
    - in app.use(session) include the following:
        - secret: sessionSecret

Create Sequelize Database
    - Verify .env has proper db parameters:
        - DB_USERNAME=cook_nook_app
        - DB_PASSWORD=password
        - DB_DATABASE=cook_nook
        - DB_HOST=localhost
        - SESSION_SECRET=<<sessionSecret>>
    - Create a user in psql (CREATE USER <<username>> WITH PASSWORD <<password>> CREATEDB;)
    - To create the database, run the following (outside of psql):
        - npx dotenv sequelize-cli db:create
    - Create as many models as you need, for example:
        - npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes username:string,emailAddress:string,hashedPassword:string
    - Update your models and migrations to reflect nullability, unique fields, type, and foreign key references
    - to migrate once complete, run the following:
        - npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate
