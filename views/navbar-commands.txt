Design a navbar
- Research competitor websites
- Have your logo, fonts, colors and icons finished
- If you can't design, zoom in on the website you are cloning or referencing and take screenshots of assets
- Make a pencil drawing (low-fidelity prototype) of your website
- Test out your prototype by tapping on the pencil buttons, etc. to see if it makes sense
- Make a prototype for free on figma.com, do a trial or buy an adobe XD subscription
- The software will tell you the width, height, HEX or RGB colors, opacity, border, screen size, hover states, animations, etc.
- Code it

Code a navbar

- You might also think of regex, but regex is slow and not good for sorting through large data
- You can do some reading on it, but to cut to the chase - USE THE BOYER MOORE PATTERN MATCHING ALGORITHM
